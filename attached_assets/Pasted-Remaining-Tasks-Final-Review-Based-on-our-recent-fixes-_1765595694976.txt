Remaining Tasks & Final Review
Based on our recent fixes and the current state of your Virtual Office application, here are the remaining items to complete:

✅ What's Been Fixed
TTS Audio Playback - Removed invalid language parameter from OpenAI API
Voice Recognition - Enhanced error logging and language initialization
Dark Theme - Implemented hacker green + robotech blue color scheme
Custom Fonts - Added Oxanium, IBM Plex Sans, JetBrains Mono via Google Fonts
Visual Feedback - Added pulse animation and mic emoji during listening
🔧 Remaining Critical Tasks
1. Arabic Language Support Verification
Status: Implemented but needs testing
Action Required: Test Arabic speech recognition (ar-SA) and verify TTS output quality
Note: OpenAI TTS has limited Arabic voice quality - consider alternative TTS services if needed
2. Error Handling & User Feedback
Add retry mechanism for failed TTS requests
Improve network error messages for non-technical users
Add loading states for conversation switching
3. Performance Optimization
Implement conversation pagination (currently loads all conversations)
Add message virtualization for long conversation histories
Optimize audio base64 encoding/decoding
4. UI/UX Enhancements
Add keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+K for new conversation, Esc to stop listening)
Implement conversation search/filter
Add agent status indicators (online/offline simulation)
Mobile responsive improvements for agent selection
5. Voice Mode Improvements
Add volume control for TTS playback
Implement speech rate adjustment
Add option to queue multiple agent responses in voice mode
Auto-scroll to playing message
6. Data Persistence & Sync
Verify conversation timestamps are correct across timezones
Add conversation export feature (JSON/Text)
Implement conversation archiving
7. Accessibility
Add ARIA labels for screen readers
Ensure keyboard navigation works throughout
Add focus indicators that match the theme

 Hacker green (#00FF88) and robotech blue (#00C2FF) colors visible
 Custom fonts (Oxanium, IBM Plex Sans, JetBrains Mono) loading
 Glow effects appear on active elements
 Pulse animation shows when listening
 Sidebar collapses/expands properly
 Mobile view agent selection works
 Scroll behavior is smooth
 Loading states show during API calls
E. Error Handling
 Network errors show appropriate messages
 Failed messages can be retried
 API rate limits handled gracefully
 Invalid input is validated before sending
 Console errors are addressed (check browser console)
F. Performance
 Page loads quickly
 Conversation switching is responsive
 No memory leaks during extended use
 Audio playback doesn't lag
 Large conversations (100+ messages) perform well
G. Data Integrity
 Messages save to database correctly

 Timestamps are correct
 User ID associations are correct
H. Cross-Browser Testing
 Test in Chrome/Edge

 Test in Safari (if available)
 Verify Web Speech API support notification works
I. Edge Cases
 Empty message submission blocked
 No agents selected shows proper warning
 Very long messages handled
 Special characters in messages work

J. Console & Logs
 CRITICAL: Check browser console for React errors (you currently have minified errors #425, #418, #423)
 Check network tab for failed API requests
 Verify no 404 errors
 Check server logs for errors
⚠️ URGENT: Fix React Errors
Your console shows 3 React errors that need immediate attention:

Error #425
Error #418
Error #423
These are minified errors. To debug them properly, run the app in development mode and check for the full error messages. These could be causing UI instability.

After verifying everything above, test the complete user journey:

Login → 2. Select agents → 3. Send message → 4. Receive responses → 5. Use voice features → 6. Create new conversation → 7. Switch conversations → 8. Delete conversation → 9. Logout
Document any issues found and prioritize fixes based on user impact.
