I need a COMPLETE, FACTUAL project inventory report of the current Replit codebase.

Rules:
- Read-only. Do NOT modify any files.
- Do NOT propose improvements.
- Do NOT market/praise.
- Output MUST be Structured Markdown with clear sections and bullet points.

Scope:
A) Full tree inventory:
1) Print the full directory tree (depth 6) including hidden config files (e.g., .replit, .env.example if exists, etc).
2) Include file sizes and last modified timestamps if available.
3) Explicitly inventory these folders if present: server/, client/, shared/, arc_core/, docs/, firmware/, android/, attached_assets/, archives/, reports/, script/.

B) Runtime usage mapping (REAL execution):
4) Identify the actual runtime entry points for production + dev:
   - server entry file(s)
   - client entry file(s)
   - build scripts
   - db migration flow (drizzle)
5) For each top-level folder, mark:
   - ACTIVE (used at runtime)
   - BUILD-ONLY (used only in build)
   - LEGACY (present but not used)
   - UNKNOWN (cannot confirm)
Provide evidence: import references or script references (file → lines / imports).

C) Attached assets inventory:
6) For attached_assets/ and any uploads folder:
   - list each file
   - type (pdf/png/jpg/docx/json/etc)
   - purpose if inferable from filename
   - whether referenced anywhere in code (search for path/name)

D) Endpoint/UI coverage mapping:
7) List all pages (routes) in client and map to backend endpoints they call.
8) Mark pages that render mock data vs real API data (show the exact source file and key variable/function).

E) Dead/duplicate/unused detection (FACTUAL only):
9) Detect:
   - duplicate pages/components
   - endpoints that exist but never called by UI
   - tables present but never written to (based on server code usage, not guessing)

Output format:
1) Executive Summary (10 lines max)
2) Directory Tree
3) Folder-by-folder inventory table (ACTIVE/BUILD/LEGACY/UNKNOWN + evidence)
4) Attached Assets inventory
5) UI→API mapping
6) Unused/Legacy findings (with evidence)
7) “What I could NOT verify”
